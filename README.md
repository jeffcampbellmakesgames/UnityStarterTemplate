## How to Use
1. On the top right of this github page, select the *Use this template* button. This will enable you to create your own version of this repository (can be made private or public).

2. One area Github's Template feature doesn't handle well is LFS which this repository has handled. To fix any broken LFS links, clone the repository locally.

3. Add a remote repository to the original template (https://github.com/jeffcampbellmakesgames/UnityStarterTemplate.git). In this example I'm giving it the name `template_origin`.

4. Fetch and pull all lfs objects from the template repository and then push them up to your own origin. This can be done with the following commands.

```
git lfs fetch template_origin
git lfs pull template_origin
git lfs push origin --all
```
